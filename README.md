# testopencv

This project was made in 2020-2021 by Lord Pinpin, David Santos, Glexis Tiamson. It involved visual imaging and processing as well as optical character recognition.
It would take a camera's footage and process whether a license was found, then use that to determine what the letters of the license plate were and raise or lower a
gate automatically in that case. test-platedetect.py has the relevant code here, and Raspberry Pi was used to create a prototype mechanism in the real world within the
btserver.py file. Since I did not know how to do deep learning or any machine learning algorithms, the program uses a preexisting test for such cases which made the project
less effective, but manageable since it was my first introduction (and the rest of the group's) to actual applied programming using Python specifically. This even was before I
delved into learning how to program with any specific language. I consulted an expert in programming when coding to help me.
