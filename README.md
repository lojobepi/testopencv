# testopencv

This project was made in 2020-2021 by Lord Pinpin, David Santos, Glexis Tiamson. It involved visual imaging and processing as well as optical character recognition.
It would take a camera's footage and process whether a license was found, then use that to determine what the letters of the license plate were and raise or lower a
gate automatically in that case. test-platedetect.py has the relevant code here, and Raspberry Pi was used to create a prototype mechanism in the real world within the
btserver.py file.

Though I no longer wish to work in that field of programming, it was my first introduction to actual applied programming using Python specifically. This was before I
even delved into learning how to program with any specific language. I had a lot of help from my father with building the code for the machine.
